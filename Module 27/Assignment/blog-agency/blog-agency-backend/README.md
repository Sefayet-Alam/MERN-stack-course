# Backend API

This is the backend of the project, built with Node.js and Express.js, which provides APIs for managing blogs, teams, and services.

## Features

- **Blog Management**:
  - Create, read, update, and delete blogs.
- **Team Management**:
  - Manage team members.
- **Service Management**:
  - Manage services offered.
- **User Authentication**:
  - Register, login, and token-based authentication.
- **Role-based Access**:

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- Node.js
- npm or yarn
- MongoDB (local or cloud-based, such as MongoDB Atlas)

## Installation and Setup

1. Clone the backend repository:
   git clone <backend-repo-url>

2. Navigate to the backend directory:
   cd backend

3. Install dependencies:
   npm install

4. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following:
   PORT=5000
   MONGO_URI=<your-mongodb-connection-string>
   JWT_SECRET=<your-jwt-secret-key>

5. Start the server:
   npm start

6. The backend API will be available at `http://localhost:5000`.
